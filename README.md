# SnakeAIFinal

This program trains a convolutional neural network to play the video game "Snake" using an evolutionary algorithm. By default, pressing 'd' enables "warp speed", which runs the program as quickly as your computer can handle and doesn't display any graphics. Bear in mind that no graphics aside from the improvement graph on the bottom and past maximum lengths on the side. Press 'a' to disable this mode. Other buttons you may see at the bottom of the main code are for debug purposes only.
